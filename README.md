# Data-Archive-Activity

The data set I analyzed was global video game sales. We tried to determie if they type of game impacted the global sales or if the type of game impacted the critic score, which in turn impacted the global sales. 
We grouped the data by the two more popular game types: sports games and shooting games. We looked at the minimum, maximum and average critic scores for each game type and then looked at the global sales for each game. 
We determined the sports related games received higher critic scores than shooter games and the sports games received the maximum global sales over shooter games. 
It was determined that sports games are more popular with critics and sell far better than shooter games.
