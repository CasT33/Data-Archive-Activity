Data Transformation Steps

1. Uploaded VideoGames raw data to Hive

2. Created a sales_genre table, loaded "VideoGames" and verified table set up

3. Selected Genre, Global_Sales, Critic_Score from Sales

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_genre
SELECT Genre, Global_Sales, Critic_Score
FROM videogames;

4. Create a query to Round Global_Sales

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_genre
SELECT Genre, ROUND (Global_Sales, 1) AS Global_Sales, Critic_Score
FROM videogames; 

5. Filter the data to only look at Critic_Score that is greater than 0

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_genre
SELECT *
FROM sales_genre
WHERE Critic_Score > 0

6. Order data by Critic_Score from highest to lowest

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE sales_genre
SELECT *
FROM sales_genre
ORDER BY Critic_Score DESC
